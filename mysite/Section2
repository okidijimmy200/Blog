Lecture 1:
Building the List and Detail view
-A Django view is just a
Python function that receives a web request and returns a web
response

**Post_list view
In this view, we are retrieving all the posts
with the published status using the published manager we created
previously.

Lecture 2:
Adding URL patterns for your views
-we add URLs for our views

Lecture 3:
Canonical URLs for models
-we add canonical URL in the models wch help us generate simple to use slugs

Lecture 4
Adding pagination
-Django has a built-in pagination class that allows you to manage paginated data
easily.

Lecture 5
Using class-based views
-you can also define your views as class methods.

Advantages of class based views over function based views
--Organizing code related to HTTP methods, such as GET, POST,
or PUT, in separate methods instead of using conditional
branching
--Using multiple inheritance to create reusable view classes
(also known as mixins)

-In order to keep pagination working, we have to use the right page
object that is passed to the template.
